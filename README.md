# horiseon-code-refractor
## Description 
Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. In this example, we are refactoring an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Edits

Added "id" to "search-engine-optimization" so that when clicking the link, users are taken to that location.




GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order


To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
